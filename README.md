# greedyFD

The "GreedyFD" function use a Traits matrix to maximize the convex hull of k species. You can penalize the algorithm using the parameter "penal" (=T or F) and set the PenalK and PenalY paraneters. I advice to use a wide range of paramters and take the maximun value of the convex hull. The "deter" parameter can be let to "TRUE" (it takes the species that maximize the convex hull at each step instead of having the possibility to take a sub-optimal solution)
